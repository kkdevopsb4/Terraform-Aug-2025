# What is Terraform & Why Terraform?

---

## 🌐 What is Terraform?

**Terraform** is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by **HashiCorp**. It allows DevOps engineers to define and provision data center infrastructure using a high-level configuration language known as **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)**.

Terraform manages both low-level components (e.g., compute, storage, networking) and high-level components (e.g., DNS, SaaS features) across **multiple cloud providers** and services.

## 📌 Key Capabilities

- **Declarative Syntax**: Describe the desired state and let Terraform manage the changes.
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Works with AWS, Azure, GCP, VMware, Kubernetes, and over 1000+ providers.
- **Provisioning**: Creates, updates, and deletes infrastructure automatically.
- **State Management**: Tracks infrastructure with a state file.
- **Modules**: Reusable components for standard infra patterns.
- **Plan & Apply**: Shows what will happen before executing it (safe infrastructure changes).

## ⚙️ Terraform Workflow

### 1. **Write**
Define infrastructure using `.tf` configuration files in HCL.
These include:
- **Terraform Configuration**: The `.tf` files
- **Terraform State File**: Tracks the deployed infrastructure

### 2. **Plan**
Preview what Terraform will do:
```bash
terraform plan
````

* Shows which resources will be created, changed, or destroyed.

### 3. **Apply**

Apply the changes to provision or update infrastructure:

```bash
terraform apply
```

* Executes the plan and updates the infrastructure.
* Updates the state file.
